        <h2>... Separating content from presentation</h2>
        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>
            The <em> and <strong> tags are better choices than <i> and <b> tags because they provide semantic meaning to the text. 
            While <i> and <b> only control the presentation (italic and bold respectively), <em> and <strong> inform both developers 
            and assistive technologies about the importance or emphasis of the content. This improves accessibility and SEO, 
            making the web content more meaningful and user-friendly.
