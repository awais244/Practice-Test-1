        <h1><strong>Comparison</strong> of <strong>Typesetting</strong> and <strong>Publishing</strong></h1>

            <h2>Old-Fashioned Typesetting</h2>
            <p>
                Traditional typesetting involved manually arranging physical letters and symbols to create text layouts.
                This process was labor-intensive and required skilled typographers to align and space text properly.
                While it offered high precision and a tactile experience, it was slow and limited in flexibility.

            <h2>Desktop Publishing</h2>
            <p>
                Desktop publishing revolutionized typesetting by introducing digital tools that enabled users to design
                layouts on computers. Software like Adobe InDesign and Microsoft Publisher allowed for faster creation
                of complex layouts with greater customization, significantly reducing production time and effort.

            <h2>HTML and CSS</h2>
            <p>
                HTML and CSS take publishing to the web, enabling dynamic and responsive layouts for digital consumption.
                HTML provides the structure of the content, while CSS handles the styling and presentation. This approach
                allows for interactivity, accessibility, and scalability, making it ideal for modern publishing needs.

            <h2>Comparison</h2>
            <p>
                While old-fashioned typesetting emphasized manual precision and craft, desktop publishing focused on
                accessibility and efficiency for print media. HTML and CSS go further by prioritizing accessibility,
                interactivity, and compatibility across digital platforms, providing a flexible solution for modern
                web publishing.
