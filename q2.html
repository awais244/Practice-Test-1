            <h1>Key Differences Between Writing in Google Docs and in an HTML Document</h1>

            <h2>1. Formatting and Structure</h2>
            <p>
                Google Docs provides a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) interface, allowing users to visually
                format text, insert images, and adjust layouts directly. In contrast, writing in an HTML document requires
                the use of markup tags to define the structure and formatting of content, which is later rendered by a browser.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Accessibility and Purpose</h2>
            <p>
                Google Docs is designed for collaborative document editing and word processing. It includes tools like
                real-time collaboration, comments, and version history. HTML documents, however, are used to create web
                pages and focus on delivering structured, semantic content for the web.
            </p>

            <h2>3. Customization and Styling</h2>
            <p>
                In Google Docs, users rely on built-in formatting options and templates. HTML documents allow for extensive
                customization using CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity, giving developers complete control
                over the appearance and behavior of the content.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Learning Curve</h2>
            <p>
                Google Docs is user-friendly and requires no technical knowledge. On the other hand, writing HTML documents
                requires familiarity with HTML syntax and often CSS and JavaScript, making it more challenging for beginners.
